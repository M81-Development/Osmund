#Hermitage

People often say that all good things will come to an end.

And today, is now time to end.

I started to Develop MeilanNote2, on July 12, 2016.

In the turning of a hand to today, February 25, 2017, has 228 days gone.

I will soon have my own family, a virtuous wife.

It is now time to say goodbye, for the better future, to strive.

Do you regret not having done？

While we are alive try again.

Thanks for us for the common spent on the past.

To treasure.

Good bye.

In the end, to express my love @ Lu Ruonan :)

Embers, February 25, 2017 in Shanghai Hongqiao.
